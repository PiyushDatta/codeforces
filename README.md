## How to use

3. Fill out `input.txt` with whatever inputs given by problem
   - First input in this file can be # of test cases
4. Fill out `output.txt` with whatever outputs given by problem

**When submitting**

Make sure to comment out these lines if neccessary (for codeforces, comment out all of them):

```
// comment out this line when submitting
#define _MY_TEST_FILES true
// comment out if the submission DOES NOT require you take multiple test cases
#define _MULTIPLE_TEST_CASES true
// comment out if the submission DOES NOT require you to print the case number
#define _PRINT_CASE_NUMBER true
```
